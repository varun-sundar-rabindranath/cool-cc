PL - Programming Languages
--------------------------

  - The PL folder is its own project. All the programming language / grammar definitions
  go here
  - Each folder in this directory is a separate programming language / grammar
  - A grammar definition is required to have the following files
    - *_ast.hpp
      - Defines the nodes in an Abstract Syntax Tree
      - All node definitions are child classes of ParseTreeNode (that is defined
        in the ../include/parser/parser_node.hpp (A completely different project)
    - *.grammar
      - Defines the terminals, non-terminals, productions and the corresponding
        semantic rules. The semantic rules are defined in terms of the definitions
        in *_ast.hpp.

  - The grammars defined in this folder is built as follows
    - The grammar file should be parsed and represented as .cpp files. This is
      done by using the parsing_files_generator_app in the root project.
      The parsing_files_generator_app, given the .grammar file, produces
      semantic_rules.cpp, and parsing_table.cpp files.
    - The .cpp files, generated by the parsing_files_generator_app is compiled
      into a library
